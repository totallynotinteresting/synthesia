the "don't be a jerk" license
Version 1, January 2026

Actually, let's just call it the "totally not interesting license".

0. You can do whatever you want with this code. Really. Copy it, paste it, print it out and eat it. I don't care. JUST DON'T SELL IT. Seriously, why would you even try to sell this? that literally goes against the point of the whole thing.


1. HOWEVER, if you use this code in your own project, you MUST credit me (totallynotinteresting) in a way that isn't hidden in a basement behind a sign saying "beware of the reddit mod". A link to the original repo or a simple "Original code by totallynotinteresting" is fine. Just don't be that person who steals stuff and pretends they're a genius.

2. If you don't credit me, I will be very disappointed. I'm not a lawyer, so I won't sue you, but I will tell everyone that you're the kind of person who doesn't tip at restaurants (aka a big meanie).

3. This software is provided "as is", which is a fancy way of saying: if it breaks your computer, eats your homework, or sets your house on fire, that's on you. I am not responsible for your life choices or your hardware's health.

ok bye (again)
