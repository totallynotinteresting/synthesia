pathcing synthesia to remove the license check, :p

so far this is only known to work on version 10.9.5893

so to use it, you need to you can run
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/totallynotinteresting/synthesia/main/patch.sh | bash`

this will download the patch and apply it to your synthesia app

to do this you need to open terminal, paste that in, and kaboom

theres no reason i did this app specifically, just wanted to lol

oh yeah pls follow the license in [LICENSE](LICENSE)
